Hello, my name is Natalia. I’d like to present to you, a case of a 3-years-old boy, with a brief description of his illness, which still remains a fatal disease in low-resource management countries.

Lets start by outlining his condition- Peter have been admitted to the hospital presenting major complaints of redness, watering and white reflex in the right eye, lingering for the last 2 months. The left eye was within normal limits. He had not had any past medical history, no history of trauma or eye infection. During his last visit to a GP, he was prescribed some eye drops (local steroid, antibiotic and lubricant) but watering and redness have developed further. In regard to family history, his 15-years-old sister was diagnosed with thalassemia major, but there were no history of similar complaints in the family. Peter was born full-term, healthy and achieved his developmental milestones adequate for his age. He didn’t have any typical infections in infancy and doesn’t take any medications. He lives with his parents and his sister in a single-family house in Poznań. His mother has not been reporting any allergies. The general physical examination showed no abnormalities.

Let me stop here for a moment because I would like to extend this point a bit further. Most of you probably catch the big red flag syndrome which is unilateral leukocoria also known as “white pupil syndrome”.This may led you to suspect the diagnosis, however you should remember, that there are other common clinical features typical for the disease, such as poorly aligned eyes (professionally called strabismus), red and painful eye (usually due to glaucoma) or poor vision. The illness itself might be rarely asymptomatic for a very long time.

Getting back to the little Peter’s case. Ocular examination was conducted: face, lid and eyelashes were normal in both eyes, ocular position and ocular movement of both eyes were full and unrestricted in all directions. Direct ophthalmoscopy showed right eye white reflex and sluggish pupillary reaction to light, the patient was not following the light. Sclera and iris details were normal in both eyes. Afterwards, the B-scan ultrasonography was performed which showed two large retinochoroidal mass lesions noted with the following dimensions ??? with the specks of calcification seen posteriorly in the right eye. Next, the doctors carried out the MRI exam which reported a hypointense lesion in the right globe filling the vitreous in T2 and isointense signal in T1. No extraocular extension. This suggested retinoblastoma of the right eye with no abnormality in brain parenchyma. The diagnosis was confirmed by a histopathology report, which also showed no invasion of an optic nerve.

In conclusion- Ultrasonography is useful tool in distinguishing retinoblastoma from non-neoplastic conditions. It is also helpful in detecting calcification. MRI may be beneficial in estimating the degree of differentiation of retinoblastoma. Studies show that on T1-weighted images, the tumors usually have a low intensity and are usually difficult to distinguish from surrounding vitreous, yet on T2-weighted images, retinoblastoma tumors demonstrate very low intensity compared to vitreous. For higher test sensitivity eye-cancer specialists would have to perform a biopsy. The Blood counts, electrolyte determination as well as urinalysis and liver function tests are useful in excluding other conditions confused with retinoblastoma, which was not relevant in this case due to pathognomonic white-pupil syndrome. Normally differential diagnosis takes into account congenital cataract, retinopathy, toxocariasis, retinal dysplasia or retinal astrocytoma.

Before we move on to the treatment, I’d like to present you the international classification of retinoblastoma. There are five groups of advancement and medical therapy is individualized to the specific patient upon whom it is based. Peter was classified into group D and transported to a clinical center with higher referral level for further management. Enucleation with an 18mm optic nerve stump was performed, followed by silicon ball implantation. Surgical removal of the tumor has been the standard management of very unfavorable retinoblastoma cases. It have been shown that the younger the patient is at the time of surgery, the more growth retardation occurs. Postoperatively Peter was prescribed Amoxicillin and reviewed after 2 days. He was also given 1st circle of high-dose chemotherapy (1st out of 6).

In such cases, general prognosis is bad and the 5-year- survival depends on the extraocular extension. Thankfully, in Peter’s case since enucleation, there were no recurrence, no distance metastasis, no choroid and optic nerve invasion after 1, 3, 6, 7 and 8 months. He is now under medical supervision and is about to turn 11 this year.

Thank you for attention.
